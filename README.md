# Halloween Challenge

## Overview

The **Halloween Challenge** is a fun, interactive web application that celebrates the Halloween spirit. I created this for a codecademy Challenge.

The application invites users to engage with the screen by clicking, bringing a festive touch to their Halloween festivities.
